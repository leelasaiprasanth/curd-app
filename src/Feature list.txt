 implementing a table with filter on headers using mat-table
 Use some sample data to show there
 Or a json file
 And keep a date field in data
 Also you can implement a drop-down from which we can select a certain period like 2 months or 3 months.. or something like Mar- APR 
To see that data only in table
Try keeping atleast 6 months of data in table with few 1-2 record of each
Try using material UI For this
Like Mar 2023 to till Aug -2023
We can select any values from those drop-downs and see from current year


Now try implementing some graphs like bar charts or histogram on the same page with the very same data is being controlled by those date drop-downs...
And try to give a download option in top right corner to download the whole page (tabel and charts) as ppt
